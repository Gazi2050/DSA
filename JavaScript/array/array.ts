/**Array
 * Arrays are linear data structures used to store elements in a contiguous memory location. They're indexed starting at 0 and support operations like traversal, insertion, and deletion. Arrays are the foundation for more advanced techniques like two-pointer and sliding window. JavaScript arrays are dynamic and come with built-in methods. Understanding core operations without built-ins is essential for mastering algorithms.
